Logic : 

Capture pictures -> send it to bdd -> get it on the edit page -> save modification -> get all images -> be able to delete.



Front-end : 
- Page 1 : display camera, btn for capture, capture image, show qrCode
- Page 2 : Get last pictures, display and edit it, show QrCode
- Page 3 : This is the page you get from the QrCode link, show a download link


Back-end : 
- Send data to bdd
- get data when it fully saved in bdd and share them to the page 2
- delete data
- update data


BDD : 
 - Add
 - Get
 - Update
 - Delete
